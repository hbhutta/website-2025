        Who am I?
      </h2>
      <p>
Hi! My name is <b>Haad Bhutta</b>, you may know me as <b>hbhutta</b> from GitHub. 

      I am an aspiring software engineer. I really like coding; specifically with JavaScript recently. I am a problem-solver,
      innovator and self-starter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 27 August 2022, I have written <span id="git-stats"><b>X lines of code across Y commits in Z repositories</b></span>.
       </p>

       <h2>About this webpage</h2>
       <p>
        I created this website beacuse I wanted to display the total lines of code I have written across all the commits I have ever made 
        across all my GitHub repositories. If you are interested in what's going on behind
        the scenes of my webpage, have a look at the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/hbhutta/website-2025/tree/main/"
          >source code</a
        >.
